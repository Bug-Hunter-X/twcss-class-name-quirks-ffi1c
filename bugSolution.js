```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Corrected Code</h2>
  <p>The issue has been resolved by using the correct and consistent class names. The styles now apply correctly and consistently.  Double-check your Tailwind configuration and make sure you're using the correct class names from your Tailwind CSS version.</p>
