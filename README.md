# Tailwind CSS: Unexpected Class Name Behavior

This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon error in Tailwind CSS involving unexpected behavior due to class names. The issue isn't a syntax error, but rather a subtle misapplication or conflict of classes that leads to unexpected rendering.

## Bug Description
The core problem stems from using incorrect or incomplete class names.  This might manifest as:

* **Missing styles:** An element fails to receive expected styles due to a typo or omission in the class names.
* **Conflicting styles:**  Conflicting or unintentionally overlapping classes override desired styles.
* **Unintended behavior:** Styles are applied unexpectedly or elements appear in unexpected positions. 

The `bug.js` file illustrates a scenario where these problems might arise. The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code in your preferred environment (e.g., a browser, React, Next.js, etc.).
3. Observe the rendered output. Notice the differences between the buggy and corrected code.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing class names, ensuring their correctness and avoiding conflicts.
